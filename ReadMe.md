# OpenBet

## What's OpenBet ?
The goal of OpenBet is to determine the best bet on a horse race.
I have made a similar project for football : https://github.com/t0mm4rx/Pronostaic.
With this project, I was able to predict about 60% of results. The problem is that a 60% result isn't sufficient to make money with betting. An other problem is that this software was recalculating FDJ (french betting company) odds. So I was playing directly against a team of statisticians.
With horse races, called TURF in France, you play against other player, cause it's a common pot. So the machine learning advantage is way higher. Horses are more predictable than football, and there are many data available.
